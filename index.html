                I worked with Professor Lu Wei to develop a data pipeline for analyzing

                captured the vibrational signatures of a variety of non-homogeneous foods.
                Using this dataset, I trained and evaluated both k-nearest neighbors (kNN)

                the Raman spectra of unknown analytes in food samples. I designed a preprocessing
                and augmentation workflow to generate a robust spectral dataset, which
                captured the vibrational signatures of a variety of non-homogeneous foods.
                Using this dataset, I trained and evaluated both k-nearest neighbors (kNN)
                and random forest classifiers to identify food samples based on their
                Raman spectra. The resulting models achieved up to 88% classification accuracy.
